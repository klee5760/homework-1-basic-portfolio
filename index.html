        <p>Hello, welcome to my site! I am Kevin Lee.</p>

        <p>
          I have an interesting thing that I want to talk. Has as anyone heard
          word convergence? Convergence is when two things come together to form
          a new thing. I have a chemical engineering degree, but I would like to
          learn coding as well. Chemical Engineering 'C' and Coding Boot Camp
          'C'; CC or double 'C'. Sounds interesting? Well, this is the future.
